Chef Sam Jackson of KO Pies woks up his his take on a down and under butternut squash and chickpea filling for a savory style Australian vegetable pie. (See his shortcrust pie dough.)
Ingredients

    1 tablespoon olive oil
    1/2 onion, fine diced
    1 stalk celery, fine diced
    1 clove garlic, fine chopped
    1/2 cup white wine
    1/2 cup tinned chickpeas, drained
    1-1/2 cups vegetable stock
    1 cup butternut squash, peeled, de-seeded, and cut into 1/4″ dice
    1/2 teaspoon salt
    1/2 teaspoon pepper
    1/4 teaspoon fresh thyme, finely chopped

Instructions

    Preheat the Hot Wok™ with lid on for about five minutes, then heat oil over high heat in the wok.
    Add the onion, celery, garlic and cook for approximately 5-6 minutes or until soft and fragrant.
    Add the wine and allow to bubble away to almost all gone.
    Add the chickpeas and the vegetable stock and bring to simmer.
    Add the squash and continue to cook for about 20 minutes or until squash is tender.
    Check consistency of filling; if too watery, increase heat and stir frequently until liquid is absorbed.
    Remove from wok, add salt, pepper and fresh thyme, and allow to cool.
    As the filling cools, place pre-cut shortcrust pastry bottoms in the Personal Pie™ maker.
    Once cooled, spoon 2 ounces (approximately 1-1/2 tablespoons) of filling into each bottom crust. Place pre-cut puff pastry on top of each.
    Close and cook for approximately 8 minutes.
