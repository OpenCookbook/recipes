# Mexican Stuffed Shells
# 
## Ingredients
- 2 tsp olive oil
- 1/4 cup diced onions
- 1/2 cup diced peppers (any color)
- 1 can of black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1-2 tablespoons of taco seasoning (either buy a packet or make your own combo with cumin, salt, garlic, chili powder, oregano, etc.), to taste
- 1/2 cup corn kernels
- 1/2 cup diced black olives
- 6 ounces cream cheese
- ~20 large/jumbo pasta shells
- 2 cups salsa
- 1 cup cheddar cheese
- 1 cup monterey jack or pepper jack cheese
- Sour cream, avocado, salsa, etc. for serving

## Directions
- Heat the oil in a frying pan and add in the onions and peppers.  Let them cook until softened, about 5-10 minutes.  Add in the beans, taco seasoning, corn and black olives.  If it is too dry, throw in a little water.  Next, add the cream cheese and stir until it is melted.  Set aside to cool.

- Meanwhile, boil the pasta shells according to the package and preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

- In a large cake pan, put about 1/2 cup of the salsa in an even layer on the bottom to prevent sticking.  Then, fill the shells with the bean mixture and place into the pan.  Cover with the rest of the salsa and bake covered for about 20 minutes.  Then sprinkle with the cheeses and bake uncovered for another 15-20 minutes until the cheese is melted and bubbly.  Top with any condiments you prefer and enjoy!
