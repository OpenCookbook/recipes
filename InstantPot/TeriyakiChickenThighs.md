# Teriyaki Chicken Thighs

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 4 skinless, boneless chicken thighs
- ½ cup brown sugar
- ½ cup soy sauce
- ¼ cup honey
- ¼ cup apple cider vinegar
- 1 (1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger, grated
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons cold water
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch



# Directions:

- Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Pour in olive oil and warm until hot. Add chicken thighs and brown on both sides, 3 to 5 minutes per side.

- Meanwhile, combine brown sugar, soy sauce, honey, apple cider vinegar, ginger, and garlic in a bowl for the marinade. Pour marinade over chicken thighs in the pot and bring to a simmer; cook for 2 minutes and scrape browned bits off bottom of pot. Turn off Saute mode. Close and lock the lid.

- Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 10 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.

- Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.

- Stir cold water and cornstarch together in a small bowl. Remove chicken thighs from Instant Pot® and transfer to a plate.

- Select Saute function. Pour cornstarch mixture into the remaining sauce in the pot. Cook until sauce has thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn off Saute mode. Pour some of the sauce over teriyaki thighs and serve.
