How To Make Kapitan Chicken Curry Recipe?
Prepare Time: 1 Hour

Cook Time: 1 Hour 20 Minutes

Ingredients
1.5 Kg Chicken Fillet
1/2 Cup Onion (Sliced)
3 Tablespoons Butter
4 Cups Water
For The Curry Sauce: (A 200 Grams Packet Is Enough For This Recipe)
½ Cup Tomato Ketchup
100 Grams Tomato Juice & Pulp(You Can Substitute This With Plain Water)  1.5 Teaspoons Powdered Bouillon
½ Teaspoon Salt
1 Teaspoon Dried Basil Leaves
½ Teaspoon Dried Oregano Leaves
For The Rice
(You Can Substitute This With Regular Rice)

Step 1. Place A Pot On The Stove And Fill It Up With Water. Then Turn The Heat On High And Bring The Water To Boil.

Step 2. Take A Strainer Or Colander And Line It Up With Sieve Or Fine Mesh Sieve.

Step 3. Rinse The Rice Under Water. Place The Strainer Over The Pot And Transfer Your Rinsed Rice Into It.

Step 4. When The Water Boils, Turn Down The Heat To Medium And Cover Up The Strainer With A Lid. Let It Steam Until Water Is Gone, Or The Water Is Just About To Be Gone From Sieve. Set Aside And Check On It Every 5 Minutes Or So, Depending On How Chewy You Want Your Rice To Be (I Like My Rice To Be A Tad Chewy).

Step 5. Remove The Lid And Transfer The Rice Into A Bowl. Set Aside And Take Out A Steamer.

Step 6. Rinse The Sieve With Water And Put Some Butter In It. Then Take A Colander And Line It Up With The Sieve That Was Just Rinsed, Placed Over The Steamer.

Step 7. Chop The Onion Into Small Pieces And Add Them To Your Butter In Sieve On Steamer.

Step 8. Put Your Chicken Fillet In The Colander On Top Of The Sieve That Has The Onion. And Put Some Butter On Top Of It As Well.

Step 9. Preparing Curry Sauce: In A Cup, Mix Together Tomato Ketchup, Tomato Juice And Pulp, Bouillon Powder, Salt, Basil Leaves, And Oregano Leaves (You Can Substitute This With Italian Seasoning If You Don’t Have These Ingredients).

Step 10. Prepare The Water For Steaming: Turn The Heat On High And Fill Up A Medium To Large Pot With Water. Then Put The Steamer On Top Of It. Make Sure That The Liquid In Your Pot Does Not Touch The Bottom Of Your Steamer.

Step 11. Pour Curry Sauce Over Chicken Fillet And Sieve Packed Rice. Top It Off With Some Dried Basil Leaves, And Place It In The Steamer Over The Water After Turning Down The Heat To Low (The Water Should Not Be Boiling At This Point).

Step 12. Steam It For About 20 Minutes.

Step 13. Take It Out And Serve. Garnish With Some Freshly Chopped Basil Leaves, Green Onions, Or Coriander Leaves (optional).

Tips
When You Cook The Chicken, Make Sure That It Is Cooked Through (i.e., Not Just For 1 Second Below 120 C). If You Like Your Curry To Be A Little On The Sweet Side, Add 2 Tbsp Sugar To Your Curry Sauce In Step 10. You Can Also Add A Little White Wine Before Serving It As A Garnish On the Top.
