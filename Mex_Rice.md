# Mexican Rice


- ▢ 3 tablespoons oil
- ▢ 2½ cups uncooked long grain white rice (450g)
- ▢ 3 cups low-sodium chicken or vegetable stock, or water + 1 bouillon cube (710 ml)
- ▢ 2 tablespoons tomato paste (or 1 cup plain tomato sauce)
- ▢ 1 teaspoon onion powder
- ▢ 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- ▢ 1 teaspoon cumin
- ▢ ½ teaspoon chili powder
- ▢ ½ teaspoon black pepper
- ▢ ½ teaspoon salt

## Instructions

- First, heat 3 tablespoons of oil in a deep skillet set over medium-high heat.
- Add the rice and stir constantly until the rice begins to turn golden brown.
- Add the chicken stock. The mixture will bubble up, and should be followed immediately by the tomato paste or tomato sauce, onion powder, garlic powder, cumin, chili powder, black pepper, and salt.
- Bring to a boil, stirring the tomato paste to dissolve it if using, and cover with a tight-fitting lid. 
- Reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes.
- During or when the rice is done cooking, you may want to check moisture levels. If you smell a hint of a burnt scent, your heat is too high! In this scenario, if the rice is cooked, remove from the heat. If it’s not cooked, lower the heat, and add water ½ cup at a time to continue the cooking process. If it’s too wet, leave the lid slightly ajar or off the pan entirely.
- When the rice is done, fluff it with a fork and serve!
